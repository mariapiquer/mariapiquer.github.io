En este artículo realizamos un diagnóstico actualizado de las presiones de conservación asociadas al uso de la tierra en las distintas ecorregiones terrestres de la Argentina.

These trade‐offs are particularly strong in tropical and subtropical deforestation frontiers, yet it remains unclear how changing landscape context in such frontiers alters agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs. We focus on the Argentinean Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, to explore how landscape context shapes trade‐off curves between agricultural intensity and avian biodiversity. We use a space‐for‐time approach and integrate a large field dataset of bird communities (197 species, 234 survey plots), three agricultural intensity metrics (meat yield, energy yield and profit) and a range of environmental covariates in a hierarchical Bayesian occupancy framework. Woodland extent in the landscape consistently determines how individual bird species, and the bird community as a whole, respond to agricultural intensity. Many species switch in their fundamental response, from decreasing occupancy with increased agricultural intensity when woodland extent in the landscape is low (loser species), to increasing occupancy with increased agricultural intensity when woodland extent is high (winner species). This suggests that landscape context strongly mediates who wins and loses along agricultural intensity gradients. Likewise, where landscapes change, such as in deforestation frontiers, the very nature of the agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs can change as landscapes transformation progresses. Synthesis and applications. Schemes to mitigate agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs, such as land sparing or sharing, must consider landscape context. Strategies that are identified based on a snapshot of data risk failure in dynamic landscapes, particularly where agricultural expansion continues to reduce natural habitats. Rather than a single, fixed strategy, adaptive management of agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs is needed in such situations. Here we provide a toolset for considering changing landscape contexts when exploring such trade‐offs. This can help to better align agriculture and biodiversity in tropical and subtropical deforestation frontiers.","tags":["adaptive management","biodiversity loss","bird assemblages","deforestation frontiers","Gran Chaco","land‐use intensity","multi‐species occupancy","tropical dry forests and savannas"],"title":"Trade-offs between biodiversity and agriculture are moving targets in dynamic landscapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Belen Lopez-Felices","Jose Aznar-Sanchez","Juan Velasco-Munoz","Maria Piquer-Rodriguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593907200,"objectID":"17fc609d7308fe49a5f5c613f9088899","permalink":"/publication/2020-07-05_lopez2020contribution/","publishdate":"2020-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-07-05_lopez2020contribution/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of irrigation ponds has proved to be an efficient alternative for increasing the availability and quality of water resources for irrigation and contributing to the sustainability of agriculture.

Therefore, human life on our planet depends on its sustainability. Research on sustainable land use in agriculture has been gaining increasing relevance since the term ‘sustainable development’ was coined with the Brundtland Report in 1987. The objective of this study is to analyse the evolution of this line of research worldwide to date. A bibliometric analysis of the existing articles from the period 1988–2017 was conducted. The results show that this topic has been gaining relevance in land use studies. Extensive cooperative networks and a high level of international collaboration exist between the different agents involved in land use studies. The analysis of key words has shown four main research lines of inquiry: agronomy, which focuses on soil processes and the study of different crops; sustainable water management for irrigation; the analysis of changes in land use, especially as related to the increase in population, the need for supplies, and the expansion of urban land; and sustainable development in new forms of agrarian management, such as organic farming, permaculture, and multifunctional systems. The regions serving as the object of these studies are mainly the Americas, Asia, Oceania, and Western Europe. This highlights a research gap in regions such as Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. Future research should examine the development of circular economic systems in agricultural activity, perceptions and preferences of stakeholders, inclusion of the sustainability objective in planning urban spaces, improvement in irrigation water use efficiency, use of nonconventional water sources in agriculture, and development of management practises and crops that can adapt to the impact of climate change.","tags":["Environment","Sustainability","Land use","Agriculture","Bibliometric analysis","Scopus"],"title":"Worldwide research trends on sustainable land use in agriculture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Nolte","Beatriz Gobbi","Yann le Polain de Waroux","Maria Piquer-Rodriguez","Van Butsic","Eric F.

Here we illustrate the importance of such shared understanding by example of a recent controversy surrounding the estimated impacts of decentralized zoning on deforestation in a major agricultural frontier, the Argentine Dry Chaco. In a recent analysis, we concluded that provincial zoning plans had significantly reduced deforestation in three provinces; critics suggest it had not. In attempting to resolve this debate, we identify six areas in which shared understanding can support more productive interaction. These include: (1) the distinction between impact and other measures of effectiveness, (2) an appreciation of recent advances in methods for causal inference, (3) the distinction between effective and perfect enforcement, (4) the challenge of attributing impacts to mechanisms and actors, (5) transparency in standards used to judge the desirability of observed outcomes, as well as (6) caution in the generalization of findings to other geographies.","tags":[],"title":"Challenges in attributing avoided deforestation to policies and actors: Lessons from provincial forest zoning in the Argentine Dry Chaco","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Piquer-Rodriguez","Van Butsic","Philipp Gärtner","Leandro Macchi","Matthias Baumann","Gregorio Pizarro Gavier","José N.

The Pampas and Chaco regions of Argentina have been global hotspots of agricultural land-use change since the 2000s, yet our understanding of what drives the spatial patterns of these land-use changes remains partial. We parameterized a net returns model of agricultural land-use change to estimate the probability of agricultural expansion (conversions of woodlands to either cropland or grazing land) and agricultural intensification (conversion of grazing land to cropland) at the 1-km scale for the years 2000 and 2010. Uniquely, our model allowed us to quantify the importance of underlying causes (i.e., changes in agricultural profit) and spatial determinants (i.e., soil fertility, distance to markets, etc.), for Argentina's prime agricultural regions as a whole. We found that cropland and grazing land expansion into woodlands was much less sensitive to changes in profit-related factors than agricultural intensification. Profit-related variables, were a particularly strong cause of intensification in the Pampas, where cropland profits rose by 29% (compared to 18% in the Chaco). This suggests that further conversions of grazing land to cropland in the Pampas and Chaco is likely as long as agricultural demand, and thus returns to agriculture, continue to be high. The moderate impact of profit-related factors on affecting woodland conversion rates also suggests a limited potential of economic policies that affect marginal profits (e.g., taxes or subsidies) to alter deforestation rates and patterns in major ways. Policies that target socio-economic variables not included in our profit-focused framework (e.g., capital availability), area-based interventions (e.g., land zoning), or less-profit oriented actors (e.g., via community-based management) might be more effective in addressing deforestation rates in the Chaco.","tags":["Cropland","Expansion","Grazing land","Intensification","Profits","Woodland loss"],"title":"Drivers of agricultural land-use change in the Argentine Pampas and Chaco regions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastián A.

In the Gran Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, rampant cropland and pasture expansion raise concerns about the sustainability of these land-use changes. Zoning policies were recently enacted in the Argentine Chaco to balance agriculture and conservation, yet the environmental outcomes of implementing these policies remain unclear. Here, we focused on the province of Formosa (Argentina) to evaluate how fully implementing zoning there would affect forest loss and connectivity, and how multiscale landscape planning could enhance environmental outcomes. Specifically, we simulated potential future forest cover for different spatial planning scenarios to assess the effect of (a) implementing regional corridors and (b) enacting additional policies to minimize forest fragmentation at the plot level, under both high and low deforestation rates. We then quantified forest connectivity and fragmentation using morphological image segmentation and landscape indices. Our results show that implementing regional corridors reduced the extent of potential deforestation by 650,000 ha (43%), and this alone strongly increased forest connectivity compared with scenarios without corridors. However, how deforestation would be carried out at the plot level was critically important. Plot-level spatial planning could have a strong and positive effect on mitigating fragmentation and on maintaining connectivity, even in scenarios with high deforestation rates (i.e., reducing the number of forest fragments by up to 35%, increasing the core forest by up to 6%). Moreover, under high deforestation rates, implementing regional corridors and plot-level design had a strong complementary effect on mitigating forest fragmentation (17% less forest fragments than when implementing either of the two strategies alone). Our analyses clearly highlight the opportunities of multiscale spatial planning and the need to complement broad-scale zoning with plot-level landscape design in order to mitigate the negative impacts of deforestation in the Chaco and other active agricultural frontiers.","tags":["agricultural expansion frontiers","corridors","deforestation","forest law","fragmentation","Gran Chaco","landscape planning"],"title":"Multiscale spatial planning to maintain forest connectivity in the Argentine Chaco in the face of deforestation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Piquer-Rodriguez","Matthias Baumann","Van Butsic","Ignacio Gasparri","Gregorio Gavier-Pizarro","José N.

Scenarios are powerful tools to explore possible future changes in agricultural land use, how these may affect the environment, and how policies may influence land-use patterns. Focusing on Argentina’s prime agricultural areas, the Pampas, Espinal and Chaco, we developed spatially-explicit future land-use scenarios from 2010 to 2030, considering both agricultural expansion (i.e., conversions from woodland to either grazing land or cropland) and agricultural intensification (i.e., conversions from grazing land to cropland). Our simulations were based on an econometric model of net returns, which assumes economically rational land-use actors. Using this model, we assessed the rates and spatial patterns of future land-use change under current land zoning in our study region, and contrasted this with a forecast of future land use based on land-conversion rates from 2000–2010. We systematically tested the impact of economic policies (e.g., taxes or subsidies), infrastructure improvement (e.g., road paving), and technological innovation (i.e., yield increases) on the spatial patterns of land-use conversions. Our model suggests future land-use change will mainly happen along intensification pathways, with deforestation slowing down, if land-use actors would be profit-maximizing. This general pattern did not change even for policy interventions that impacted profits from agriculture in major ways, cautioning against overestimating the leverage that economic policies provide for halting deforestation. Improving the region’s road network would create a strong incentive to expand cropland further into remaining woodlands and over grazing lands. However, low agricultural profits and higher yields could curb deforestation in marginal areas to some extent. We also highlight that priority areas for conservation are particularly likely to experience high land-use pressure in the future. Given the lower-than-expected power of economic policies to alter deforestation patterns in our models, zoning, if properly enforced, appears to be a more straightforward tool for avoiding unwanted environmental impacts in the Chaco.","tags":["Net returns model","Profits","Economic policies","Deforestation","Chaco","Espinal","Pampa","Conservation planning","Zoning","Tropical dry forests"],"title":"The potential impact of economic policies on future land-use conversions in Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Piquer-Rodriguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493683200,"objectID":"f7fe882c1d28b8ac77224edd64a489a0","permalink":"/publication/2017-02-20_piquer-rodriguez2017/","publishdate":"2017-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-02-20_piquer-rodriguez2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Agricultural expansion and intensification drive the conversion of natural areas worldwide. This trend will likely continue, particularly in South America, as rising global population, dietary shifts and the increasing importance of biofuels will further accelerate the demand in agricultural products. Yet, it is not clear where and how much production would need to expand and intensify to meet future demands and how policies may help minimizing environmental trade-offs. Particularly the latter requires an understanding of the underlying forces that drive agricultural land-use changes and how they play out given different spatial characteristics of regions. In concert with scenario analyses, this offers a framework for planners and decision makers to explore potential impacts from policies, especially in very dynamic regions. Argentina, where agricultural expansion and intensification result in dramatic conversions of natural areas, is a good example of a dynamic human-environment system. The overarching goal of this thesis was to understand the drivers of agricultural land-use change and to explore future trajectories of land-use change, and how economic and conservation policies may impact them in Argentina’s most important agricultural areas. First, this thesis examines drivers of agricultural land-use changes using a net returns model of agricultural production. Then, this thesis evaluates the effects of economic and conservation policies on future land-use changes and on the connectivity of forests by developing scenarios of future land-use change. The results highlight that agricultural intensification in Argentina is driven by economic interventions, whereas agricultural expansion primarily responds to environmental characteristics and zonation programs. In addition, economic policies may have less power in governing land use changes than previously thought, as results suggest that there are other factors, than profit maximization, influencing land conversions. Future agricultural development would occur in priority areas for conservation in Argentina, but zonation policies, such as the Forest Law, appear to be powerful in limiting potential environmental trade-offs. Results also show that conservation planning does not necessarily need to conflict with economic development in Argentina, since under similar deforestation rates; landscape planning can preserve forest connectivity in the Chaco. Overall, this thesis highlights that a-priory evaluation of potential future effects of economic and conservation policies on land-use change can help informing spatial and conservation planning to steer development pathways towards desired directions in dynamic agricultural regions.","tags":["connectivity","deforestation","fragmentation","cropland","grazing land","Pampas","Chaco","Espinal"],"title":"Effects of policies and zoning on future land use in Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Verena Fehlenberg","Matthias Baumann","Ignacio Gasparri","Maria Piquer-Rodriguez","Gregorio Pizarro Gavier","Tobias Kuemmerle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"7416f8a5c03b3fba3568a6ad331e77b5","permalink":"/publication/2017-05-01_fehlenberg2017/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-05-01_fehlenberg2017/","section":"publication","summary":"South America’s tropical dry forests and savannas are under increasing pressure from agricultural expansion. Cattle ranching and soybean production both drive these forest losses, but their relative importance remains unclear. Also unclear is how soybean expansion elsewhere affects deforestation via pushing cattle ranching to deforestation frontiers. To assess these questions, we focused on the Chaco, a 110 million ha ecoregion extending into Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, with about 8 million ha of deforestation in 2000–2012. We used panel regressions at the district level to quantify the role of soybean expansion in driving these forest losses using a wide range of environmental and socio-economic control variables. Our models suggest that soybean production was a direct driver of deforestation in the Argentine Chaco only (0.08 ha new soybean area per ha forest lost), whereas cattle ranching was significantly associated with deforestation in all three countries (0.02 additional cattle per hectare forest loss). However, our models also suggested Argentine soybean cultivation may indirectly be linked to deforestation in the Bolivian and Paraguayan Chaco. We furthermore found substantial time-delayed effects in the relationship of soybean expansion in Argentina and Paraguay (i.e., soybean expansion in one year resulted in deforestation several years later) and deforestation in the Chaco, further suggesting that possible displacement effects within and between Chaco countries may at least partly drive forest loss. Altogether, our study showed that deforestation in the Chaco appears to be mainly driven by the globally surging demand for soybean, although regionally other proximate drivers are sometimes important. Steering agricultural production in the Chaco and other tropical dry forests onto sustainable pathways will thus require policies that consider these scale effects and that account for the regional variation in deforestation drivers within and across countries.","tags":["Deforestation","Dry forests","Savannas","Soybean","Cattle ranching","Drivers of land-use change","Gran chaco"],"title":"The role of soybean production as an underlying driver of deforestation in the South American Chaco","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Kuemmerle","Mariana Altrichter","Germán Baldi","Marcel Cabido","Micaela Camino","Erika Cuellar","Rosa Leny Cuellar","Julieta Decarre","Sandra Díaz","Ignacio Gasparri","Gregorio Gavier-Pizarro","Rubén Ginzburg","Anthony J.

An important debate concerns the levels of governance at which deforestation can be reduced effectively. Political economic theory and evidence suggests that national governments are more likely than subnational governments in agricultural frontiers to adopt restrictive forest conservation policies, due to differences in political constituencies and capacity. Here we examine the validity of this claim using an impact study of provincial-level land use planning in Argentina's main deforestation frontier, the Dry Chaco. In 2007, Argentina's provinces were obliged to define land use zoning for their native forests, but had considerable leeway in its implementation. We use data from 30,126 properties in the provinces of Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Chaco, and a rigorous counterfactual estimation strategy to quantify the extent to which adopted zoning plans affected deforestation. We find evidence that provincial-level land use zoning reduced deforestation in all three provinces, but not in all zones and periods. Differences in impact are associated with differences in the location of zones and the timing of planning. Our findings suggest that subnational governments can make important contributions to reducing large-scale deforestation in agricultural frontiers.","tags":["Argentina","Chaco","Avoided deforestation","Subnational","Governance","Matching"],"title":"Decentralized land use zoning reduces large-scale deforestation in a major agricultural frontier","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Baumann","Christoph Israel","María Piquer-Rodríguez","Gregorio Gavier-Pizarro","José Norberto Volante","Tobias Kuemmerle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485302400,"objectID":"05538e7b39eba7f55679c93dc2ef44e9","permalink":"/publication/2017-01-25_baumann2017a/","publishdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-01-25_baumann2017a/","section":"publication","summary":"The dry forests of Latin America are among the most dynamic deforestation frontiers in the world and are important carbon and biodiversity reservoirs. Our knowledge on the spatial patterns of deforestation and its proximate drivers remains partial though. We used the full Landsat image archive to reconstruct deforestation and post-deforestation dynamics between 1987 and 2012 for the entire Paraguayan Chaco, where deforestation has been rampant recently. Our classification resulted in reliable land-use change maps (86.16%), highlighting drastic forest losses of almost 44,000 km2 between 1987 and 2012, equaling a deforestation rate of 27% and about 1% yearly, predominantly for grasslands. These likely represented new pastures, making pasture expansion the dominant proximate cause of deforestation. Cropland expansion, in contrast, only played a minor role as a proximate deforestation cause in the Paraguayan Chaco. Deforestation more than doubled between 2001 and 2012 (~29,000 km2) compared to 1987–2000 (~14,000 km2), due to leakage effects from the deforestation ban in the Paraguayan Atlantic Forests in 2004. Interestingly, while grasslands expanded in the Paraguayan Chaco between 1987 and 2000, cattle numbers decreased during the same time period, though strongly increased since. This apparent decoupling of area change and land-use intensity may indicate that the Paraguayan Chaco experienced an amplification period during the 1990s followed by an intensification period since 2001. Thus, our results highlight the need for both, a more detailed monitoring of post-deforestation dynamics and a land systems perspective in order to understand deforestation frontiers and thus ultimately to identify strategies to better balance production and conservation goals.","tags":["Subtropical deforestation","Proximate drivers","Intensification","Landsat composites","Cattle ranching","Chaco","Remote sensing"],"title":"Deforestation and cattle expansion in the Paraguayan Chaco 1987--2012","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Baumann","Ignacio Gasparri","María Piquer‐Rodríguez","Gregorio Gavier Pizarro","Patrick Griffiths","Patrick Hostert","Tobias Kuemmerle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477440000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477440000,"objectID":"837dd5d7e6ec54fd7909dc0db57d7fa8","permalink":"/publication/2016-10-26_baumann2016b/","publishdate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-10-26_baumann2016b/","section":"publication","summary":"Carbon emissions from land‐use changes in tropical dry forest systems are poorly understood, although they are likely globally significant. The South American Chaco has recently emerged as a hot spot of agricultural expansion and intensification, as cattle ranching and soybean cultivation expand into forests, and as soybean cultivation replaces grazing lands. Still, our knowledge of the rates and spatial patterns of these land‐use changes and how they affected carbon emissions remains partial. We used the Landsat satellite image archive to reconstruct land‐use change over the past 30 years and applied a carbon bookkeeping model to quantify how these changes affected carbon budgets. Between 1985 and 2013, more than 142 000 km2 of the Chaco's forests, equaling 20% of all forest, was replaced by croplands (38.9%) or grazing lands (61.1%). Of those grazing lands that existed in 1985, about 40% were subsequently converted to cropland. These land‐use changes resulted in substantial carbon emissions, totaling 824 Tg C between 1985 and 2013, and 46.2 Tg C for 2013 alone. The majority of these emissions came from forest‐to‐grazing‐land conversions (68%), but post‐deforestation land‐use change triggered an additional 52.6 Tg C. Although tropical dry forests are less carbon‐dense than moist tropical forests, carbon emissions from land‐use change in the Chaco were similar in magnitude to those from other major tropical deforestation frontiers. Our study thus highlights the urgent need for an improved monitoring of the often overlooked tropical dry forests and savannas, and more broadly speaking the value of the Landsat image archive for quantifying carbon fluxes from land change.","tags":["carbon bookkeeping model","deforestation frontiers","Landsat image archive","land‐use change","post‐deforestation dynamics","savannas","tropical dry forests"],"title":"Carbon emissions from agricultural expansion and intensification in the Chaco","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Baumann","María Piquer-Rodríguez","Verena Fehlenberg","Gregorio Gavier Pizarro","Tobias Kuemmerle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"c959014c0696250e8553e93fe2e6071a","permalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_baumann2016a/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_baumann2016a/","section":"publication","summary":"The dry forests of the Chaco in South America are under great land conversion pressure, mostly for establishing pastures and soybean fields. Taking recent estimates into account, the rates at which forests are disappearing are similar to those of the Amazon, but compared to the Amazon, the Chaco remains fairly understudied. The land transformations during the past decades went along with a substantial change in the type of actors dominating the Chaco landscape. In this chapter, we discuss the land changes in the Chaco during the past 30 years with emphasis on the actors driving these changes, as outlined in the conceptual chapter of this book section. In the Chaco, it appears that the competition over land is a competition in which the actors are endowed with varying degrees of power, resulting in highly unbalanced competition. This chapter highlights these differences and discusses the potential role of the state as an actor in the competition for land that may help to slow down deforestation in the area and guide the Chaco toward more sustainable land-use futures.","tags":[],"title":"Land-use competition in the South American Chaco","type":"publication"},{"authors":["María Piquer-Rodríguez","Sebastián Torella","Gregorio Gavier-Pizarro","José Volante","Daniel Somma","Rubén Ginzburg","Tobias Kuemmerle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1421798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1421798400,"objectID":"33ef1bda368eb62db31af6671b07d4cd","permalink":"/publication/2015-01-01_piquer-rodriguez2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-01-01_piquer-rodriguez2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Land-use change is the main driver of habitat loss and fragmentation worldwide. The rate of dry forest loss in the South American Chaco is among the highest in the world, mainly due to the expansion of soybean production and cattle ranching. Argentina recently implemented a national zoning plan (i.e., the Forest Law) to reduce further forest loss. However, it is unclear how the effects of past deforestation and the implementation of the Forest Law will affect forest connectivity in the Chaco. Our main goal was to evaluate the potential effect of the Forest Law on forest fragmentation and connectivity in the Argentine Chaco. We studied changes in the extent, fragmentation, and connectivity of forests between 1977 and 2010, by combining agricultural expansion and forest cover maps, and for the future in a scenario analysis. Past agricultural expansion translated into an overall loss of 22.5 % of the Argentine Chaco’s forests, with deforestation rates in 2000–2010 up to three times higher than in the 1980s. Forest fragmentation and connectivity loss were highest in 1977–1992, when road construction fragmented large forest patches. Our future scenario analysis showed that if the Forest Law will be implemented as planned, forest area and connectivity in the region will decline drastically. Land-use planning designed to protect stepping stones could substantially mitigate connectivity loss due to deforestation, with the co-benefit of preserving the greatest amount of biodiversity priority areas across all evaluated scenarios. Including scenario analyses that assess forest fragmentation and connectivity at the ecoregion scale is thus important in upcoming revisions of the Argentine Forest Law, and, more generally, in debates about sustainable resource use.","tags":["Agriculture expansion","Subtropical dry forest fragmentation","Ecoregional conservation planning","Future scenarios","National Forest Law","Stepping stones"],"title":"Effects of past and future land conversions on forest connectivity in the Argentine Chaco","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia V.

The collapse of socialism in Russia in 1991 caused a major socioeconomic shock, including a sharp increase in poverty. We analyzed population trends of 8 large mammals in Russia from 1981 to 2010 (i.e., before and after the collapse). We hypothesized that the collapse would first cause population declines, primarily due to overexploitation, and then population increases due to adaptation of wildlife to new environments following the collapse. The long‐term Database of the Russian Federal Agency of Game Mammal Monitoring, consisting of up to 50,000 transects that are monitored annually, provided an exceptional data set for investigating these population trends. Three species showed strong declines in population growth rates in the decade following the collapse, while grey wolf (Canis lupus) increased by more than 150%. After 2000 some trends reversed. For example, roe deer (Capreolus spp.) abundance in 2010 was the highest of any period in our study. Likely reasons for the population declines in the 1990s include poaching and the erosion of wildlife protection enforcement. The rapid increase of the grey wolf populations is likely due to the cessation of governmental population control. In general, the widespread declines in wildlife populations after the collapse of the Soviet Union highlight the magnitude of the effects that socioeconomic shocks can have on wildlife populations and the possible need for special conservation efforts during such times.","tags":["change point","game mammals","population trend","Russia","socioeconomic shock"],"title":"Rapid declines of large mammal populations after the collapse of the Soviet Union","type":"publication"},{"authors":["María Piquer-Rodríguez","Tobias Kuemmerle","Domingo Alcaraz-Segura","Raul Zurita-Milla","Javier Cabello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"71b20dbe415bf7f95214f616cc26f695","permalink":"/publication/2012-01-01_piquer-rodriguez2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-01-01_piquer-rodriguez2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Land-use change is a major driver of the global biodiversity crisis, mainly via the fragmentation and loss of natural habitat. Although land-use changes will accelerate to meet humankind's growing demand for agricultural products, conservation planning rarely considers future land uses and how they may affect the connectivity of ecological networks. Here, we integrate land-use models with landscape fragmentation and connectivity analyses, to assess the effects of past and future land-use changes on the connectivity of protected area networks for a highly dynamic region in southeast Spain. Our results show a continued geographical polarisation of land use, with agricultural intensification and urban development in the coastal areas, and the abandonment of traditional land use in the mountains (e.g., 1100 km2 of natural vegetation are projected to be lost in coastal areas whereas 32 km2 of natural vegetation would recover in interior areas from 1991 to 2015). As a result, coastal protected areas will experience increasing isolation. The connectivity analyses reveal that the two protected area networks in place in the study area, the European “Natura 2000” and the Andalusian “RENPA” networks, include many landscape connectors. However, we identify two areas that currently lack protection but contain several important patches for maintaining the region's habitat connectivity: the northwestern and the southwestern slopes of the Sierra Cabrera and Bédar protected area. Our results highlight the importance of considering future land-use trajectories in conservation planning to maintain connectivity at the regional scale, and to improve the resilience of conservation networks.","tags":["Cellular automata","Conservation planning","Fragmentation","Land abandonment","Land-use intensification","Markov chains","Morphological spatial pattern analysis","Polarisation","Urbanisation"],"title":"Future land use effects on the connectivity of protected area networks in southeastern Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Domingo Alcaraz Segura","José María Paruelo","Cecilio Oyonarte Gutierrez","Maria Piquer Rodriguez","Javier Cabello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1091318400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1091318400,"objectID":"471715652d1491d6db063a7c5836b363","permalink":"/publication/2004-01-01_alcarazsegura2004/","publishdate":"2004-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2004-01-01_alcarazsegura2004/","section":"publication","summary":"El cambio global, a través de las modificaciones en el clima y en el uso del suelo, afectará de forma importante a la biodiversidad.
